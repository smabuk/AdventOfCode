	 * 
	 * --- Day 1: Report Repair ---
	 * After saving Christmas five years in a row, you've decided to take a vacation at a nice 
	 * resort on a tropical island. Surely, Christmas will go on without you.
	 * 
	 * The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only. The gold coins used there 
	 * have a little picture of a starfish; the locals just call them stars. None of the currency 
	 * exchanges seem to have heard of them, but somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins 
	 * by the time you arrive so you can pay the deposit on your room.
	 * 
	 * To save your vacation, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.
	 * 
	 * Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the 
	 * Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle 
	 * grants one star. Good luck!
	 * 
	 * Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your expense report (your 
	 * puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up.
	 * 
	 * Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and then multiply those 
	 * two numbers together.
	 * 
	 * For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:
	 * 
	 * 1721
	 * 979
	 * 366
	 * 299
	 * 675
	 * 1456
	 * In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. Multiplying them together 
	 * produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.
	 * 
	 * Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum to 2020; what do 
	 * you get if you multiply them together?
	 * 
	 * To begin, get your puzzle input.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * --- Part Two ---
	 * The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers you a starfish 
	 * coin they had left over from a past vacation. They offer you a second one if you can find 
	 * three numbers in your expense report that meet the same criteria.
	 * 
	 * Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to 2020 are 979, 366, and 675. 
	 * Multiplying them together produces the answer, 241861950.
	 * 
	 * In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries that sum to 2020?
	 *
